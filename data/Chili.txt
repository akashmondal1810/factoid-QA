chili con carne (often known simply as chili) is a spicy stew. the name of the dish derives from the spanish chile con carne, "chili pepper with meat". traditional versions are made, minimally, from chili peppers, garlic, onions, and cumin, along with chopped or ground beef. beans and tomatoes are frequently included. variations, both geographic and personal, may involve different types of meat as well as a variety of other ingredients.
