tortilla means "little torta" or "little cake" in spanish; the spanish word applies to several different foods eaten in various spanish-speaking countries. the spanish word is used in english for a more restricted range of foods, mainly a potato-based omelette originating in spain, and for a flatbread made from corn or wheat originally made by mesoamerican peoples. tortillas are used to prepare many mexican and, more generally, latin american dishes (e.g. burritos, quesadillas, tacos, tostadas).
