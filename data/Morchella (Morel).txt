the scientific name of morchella (morel) is morchellaceae. the morchellaceae are a family of ascomycete fungi. according to a standard reference work, the family has contained at least 49 species distributed among 4 genera, but in 2012, 5 genera producing the sequestrate and hypogeous ascoma were added. the best-known members are the highly regarded and commercially picked true morels of the genus morchella, the thimble morels of the genus verpa, and a genus of cup-shaped fungi disciotis. the remaining four genera produce the sequestrate fruit bodies. analysis of the ribosomal dna of many of the pezizales showed the three genera verpa, morchella, and disciotis to be closely related. thus they are now included in the family morchellaceae.
