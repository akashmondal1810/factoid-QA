bread is the staple food in europe, european-derived cultures such as the americas, and the middle east and north africa, as opposed to east asia whose staple is rice. bread is usually made from a wheat-flour dough that is cultured with yeast, allowed to rise, and finally baked in an oven. owing to its high levels of gluten (which give the dough sponginess and elasticity), common wheat (also known as bread wheat) is the most common grain used for the preparation of bread, but bread is also made from the flour of other wheat species (including durum, spelt and emmer), rye, barley, maize (corn), and oats, usually, but not always, in combination with wheat flour.
