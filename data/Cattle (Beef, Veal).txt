the scientific name of cattle (beef, veal) is bos taurus. cattle (colloquially cows) are the most common type of large domesticated ungulates. they are a prominent modern member of the subfamily bovinae, are the most widespread species of the genus bos, and are most commonly classified collectively as bos primigenius. cattle are raised as livestock for meat (beef and veal), as dairy animals for milk and other dairy products, and as draft animals (oxen or bullocks) (pulling carts, plows and the like). other products include leather and dung for manure or fuel. in some regions, such as parts of india, cattle have significant religious meaning. from as few as 80 progenitors domesticated in southeast turkey about 10,500 years ago, an estimated 1.3 billion cattle are in the world today. in 2009, cattle became the first livestock animal to have a fully mapped genome.
