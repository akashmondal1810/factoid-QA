the scientific name of welsh onion is allium fistulosum. allium fistulosum l. (welsh onion, japanese bunching onion) is a perennial onion. other names that may be applied to this plant include green onion, spring onion, scallion, escallion, and salad onion. these names are ambiguous, as they may also be used to refer to any young green onion stalk, whether grown from welsh onions, common onions, or other similar members of the genus allium (see scallion). the species is very similar in taste and odor to the related common onion, allium cepa, and hybrids between the two (tree onions) exist. the welsh onion, however, does not develop bulbs, and possesses hollow leaves ("fistulosum" means "hollow") and scapes. large varieties of the welsh onion resemble the leek, such as the japanese 'negi', whilst smaller varieties resemble chives. many welsh onions can multiply by forming perennial evergreen clumps. next to culinary use, it is also grown in a bunch as an ornamental plant.
