crustaceans (crustacea) form a very large group of arthropods, usually treated as a subphylum, which includes such familiar animals as crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, krill and barnacles. the 67,000 described species range in size from stygotantulus stocki at 0.1 mm (0.004 in), to the japanese spider crab with a leg span of up to 3.8 m (12.5 ft) and a mass of 20 kg (44 lb). like other arthropods, crustaceans have an exoskeleton, which they moult to grow. they are distinguished from other groups of arthropods, such as insects, myriapods and chelicerates, by the possession of biramous (two-parted) limbs, and by the nauplius form of the larvae.most crustaceans are free-living aquatic animals, but some are terrestrial (e.g. woodlice), some are parasitic (e.g. rhizocephala, fish lice, tongue worms) and some are sessile (e.g. barnacles). the group has an extensive fossil record, reaching back to the cambrian, and includes living fossils such as triops cancriformis, which has existed apparently unchanged since the triassic period.
