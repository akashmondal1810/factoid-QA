a nut is defined botanically as a fruit composed of a hard shell and a seed, where the hard-shelled fruit does not open to release the seed (indehiscent). in a culinary context, a wide variety of dried seeds are often called nuts, but in a botanical context, only ones that include the indehiscent fruit are considered true nuts.most seeds come from fruits that naturally free themselves from the shell, unlike nuts such as hazelnuts, chestnuts, and acorns, which have hard shell walls and originate from a compound ovary. culinary usage of the term is less restrictive, and some nuts as defined in food preparation, like almonds, pecans, pistachios, walnuts, and brazil nuts, are not nuts in a botanical sense. common usage of the term often refers to any hard-walled, edible kernel as a nut.
