the scientific name of pepper (c. frutescens) is capsicum annuum var. annuum. capsicum frutescens is a species of chili pepper that is sometimes considered to be part of the species capsicum annuum. pepper cultivars in capsicum frutescens can be annual or short-lived perennial plants. flowers are white with a greenish white or greenish yellow corolla, and are either insect- or self-pollinated. the plants' berries typically grow erect; ellipsoid-conical to lanceoloid shaped. they are usually very small and pungent, growing 10?20mm long and 3?7mm in diameter. fruit typically grows a pale yellow and matures to a bright red, but can also be other colors. c. frutescens has a smaller variety of shapes compared to other capsicum species, likely because of the lack of human selection. more recently, however, c. frutescens has been bred to produce ornamental strains, because of its large quantities of erect peppers growing in colorful ripening patterns.
