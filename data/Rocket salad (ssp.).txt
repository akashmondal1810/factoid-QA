the scientific name of rocket salad (ssp.) is eruca vesicaria ssp. sativa. eruca sativa (syn. e. vesicaria subsp. sativa (miller) thell., brassica eruca l.) is an edible annual plant, commonly known as salad rocket, roquette, rucola, rugula, colewort, and, in the united states, arugula. it is sometimes conflated with diplotaxis tenuifolia, the perennial wall rocket, another plant of the brassicaceae family, which in the past was used in the same manner. eruca sativa, which is widely popular as a salad vegetable, is a species of eruca native to the mediterranean region, from morocco and portugal in the west to syria, lebanon and turkey in the east. the latin adjective sativa in the plant's binomial is derived from satum, the supine of the verb sero, meaning "to sow", indicating that the seeds of the plant were sown in gardens. eruca sativa differs from e. vesicaria in having early deciduous sepals. some botanists consider it a subspecies of eruca vesicaria: e. vesicaria subsp. sativa. still others do not differentiate between the two.
