the scientific name of pacific halibut is hippoglossus stenolepis. hippoglossus stenolepis, the pacific halibut, is a species of righteye flounder. this very large species of flatfish is native to the north pacific and supports important commercial fishery.pacific halibut have diamond-shaped bodies. they are more elongated than most flatfishes, the width being about one-third of the length. it has a high arch in the lateral line over the pectoral fin, and a lunate, or crescent-shaped tail, which is different from other flat fishes. small scales are embedded in the skin. halibut have both eyes on their dark or upper sides. the color on the dark side varies, but tends to assume the coloration of the ocean bottom. the underside is lighter, appearing more like the sky from below. this color adaptation allows halibut to avoid detection by both prey and predator. they are one of the largest flatfish (only surpassed by the closely related atlantic halibut), and can weigh up to 500 lb (230 kg) and grow to over 8 ft (2.4 m) long.
