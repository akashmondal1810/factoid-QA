the scientific name of dill is anethum graveolens. dill (anethum graveolens), also known as lao coriander, depending on where it is grown, is either a perennial or annual herb. it is the sole species of the genus anethum.  dill is widely grown in eurasia where its leaves and seeds are used as a herb or spice for flavouring food. like caraway, the fern-like leaves of dill are aromatic and are used to flavor many foods such as gravlax (cured salmon) and other fish dishes, borscht and other soups, as well as pickles (where the dill flower is sometimes used). dill is best when used fresh as it loses its flavor rapidly if dried; however, freeze-dried dill leaves retain their flavor relatively well for a few months [wikipedia].
