the scientific name of muskmelon is cucumis melo. muskmelon (cucumis melo) is a species of melon that has been developed into many cultivated varieties. these include smooth skinned varieties such as honeydew, crenshaw and casaba, and different netted cultivars (cantaloupe, persian melon and santa claus or christmas melon). the armenian cucumber is also a variety of muskmelon, but its shape, taste, and culinary uses more closely resemble those of a cucumber. the large number of cultivars in this species approaches that found in wild cabbage, though morphological variation is not as extensive. it is a fruit of a type called pepo. muskmelon is native to persia, anatolia, armenia, and adjacent areas on the west and the east which is believed to be their center of origin and development, with a secondary center including the northwest provinces of india and afghanistan. although truly wild forms of c. melo have not been found, several related wild species have been noted in those regions.
