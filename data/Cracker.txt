a cracker is a baked good typically made from grain flour dough and usually manufactured in large quantities. crackers (equivalent to savory biscuits in the uk) are usually flat, crisp, small in size and are made in various shapes, though are commonly round or square. flavorings or seasonings, such as salt, herbs, seeds, and/or cheese, may be added to the dough or sprinkled on top before baking. crackers are eaten on their own, or can accompany other food items, such as cheese or meat slices, or dips.
