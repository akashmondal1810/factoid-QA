the scientific name of peanut is arachis hypogaea. the peanut, also known as the groundnut and the goober and taxonomically classified as <i>arachis hypogaea</i>, is a legume crop grown mainly for its edible seeds. it is widely grown in the tropics and subtropics, being important to both small and large commercial producers. it is classified as both a grain legume and, because of its high oil content, an oil crop. world annual production of shelled peanuts was 42 million tonnes in 2014. atypically among crop plants, peanut pods develop underground rather than aboveground. it is this characteristic that the botanist linnaeus used to assign the specific name <i>hypogaea</i>, which means "under the earth."
