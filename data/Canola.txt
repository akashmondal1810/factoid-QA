canola refers to a cultivar of either rapeseed (brassica napus l.) or field mustard (brassica campestris l. or brassica rapa var.). its seeds are used to produce edible oil suitable for consumption by humans and livestock. originally, canola was bred naturally from rapeseed in canada by keith downey and baldur r. stefansson in the early 1970s, but it has a very different nutritional profile in addition to much less erucic acid. the name "canola" was derived from "canadian oil, low acid" in 1978.
