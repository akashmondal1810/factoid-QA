the scientific name of pigeon pea is cajanus cajan. the pigeon pea (cajanus cajan) is a perennial legume from the family fabaceae. since its domestication in india at least 3,500 years ago, its seeds have become a common food grain in asia, africa, and latin america. it is consumed on a large scale mainly in south asia and is a major source of protein for the population of that subcontinent. pigeon peas are both a food crop (dried peas, flour, or green vegetable peas) and a forage/cover crop. in combination with cereals, pigeon peas make a well-balanced human food. the dried peas may be sprouted briefly, then cooked, for a flavor different from the green or dried peas. sprouting also enhances the digestibility of dried pigeon peas via the reduction of indigestible sugars that would otherwise remain in the cooked dried peas. pigeon peas contain high levels of protein and the important amino acids methionine, lysine, and tryptophan.
