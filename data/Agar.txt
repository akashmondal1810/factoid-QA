the scientific name of agar is eucheuma. agar or agar-agar is a gelatinous substance derived by boiling a polysaccharide in red algae, where it accumulates in the cell walls of agarophyte and serves as the primary structural support for the algae's cell walls. agar is a mixture of two components: the linear polysaccharide agarose, and a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules called agaropectin. throughout history into modern times, agar has been chiefly used as an ingredient in desserts throughout asia and also as a solid substrate to contain culture medium for microbiological work. agar (agar-agar) can be used as a laxative, an appetite suppressant, vegetarian gelatin substitute, a thickener for soups, in fruit preserves, ice cream, and other desserts, as a clarifying agent in brewing, and for sizing paper and fabrics. the gelling agent is an unbranched polysaccharide obtained from the cell walls of some species of red algae, primarily from the genera gelidium and gracilaria. for commercial purposes, it is derived primarily from gelidium amansii. in chemical terms, agar is a polymer made up of subunits of the sugar galactose.
