the scientific name of black-eyed pea is vigna unguiculata ssp. unguiculata. the black-eyed pea or black-eyed bean, a legume, is a subspecies of the cowpea, grown around the world for its medium-sized, edible bean. the bean mutates easily, giving rise to a number of varieties. the common commercial one is called the california blackeye; it is pale-colored with a prominent black spot. the currently accepted botanical name is vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata, although previously it was classified in the genus phaseolus. vigna unguiculata subsp. dekindtiana is the wild relative and vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis is the related asparagus bean. other beans of somewhat similar appearance, such as the frijol ojo de cabra (goat's eye bean) of northern mexico, are sometimes incorrectly called black-eyed peas, and vice versa.
