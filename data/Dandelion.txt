the scientific name of dandelion is taraxacum officinale. taraxacum is a large genus of flowering plants in the family asteraceae. they are native to eurasia and north and south america, and two species, t. officinale and t. erythrospermum, are found as weeds worldwide. both species are edible in their entirety. the common name dandelion (from french dent-de-lion, meaning "lion's tooth") is given to members of the genus, and like other members of the asteraceae family, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. each single flower in a head is called a floret. many taraxacum species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.
