the scientific name of spelt is triticum spelta. spelt, also known as dinkel wheat, or hulled wheat, is a species of wheat cultivated since 5000 bce. spelt was an important staple in parts of europe from the bronze age to medieval times; it now survives as a relict crop in central europe and northern spain and has found a new market as a health food. spelt is sometimes considered a subspecies of the closely related species common wheat (t. aestivum), in which case its botanical name is considered to be triticum aestivum subsp. spelta. it is a hexaploid wheat, which means it has six sets of chromosomes.
