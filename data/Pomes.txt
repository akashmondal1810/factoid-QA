in botany, a pome (after the latin word for fruit: p?mum) is a type of fruit produced by flowering plants in the subtribe malinae of the family rosaceae.a pome is an accessory fruit composed of one or more carpels surrounded by accessory tissue. the accessory tissue is interpreted by some specialists as an extension of the receptacle and is then referred to as "fruit cortex", and by others as a fused hypanthium or "torus"; it is the most edible part of this fruit.the carpels of a pome are fused within the "core". although the exocarp, mesocarp, and endocarp of some other fruit types look very much like the skin, flesh, and core respectively of a pome, they are parts of the carpel. the exocarp and mesocarp of a pome may be fleshy and difficult to distinguish from one another and from the hypanthial tissue. the endocarp forms a leathery or stony case around the seed, and corresponds to what is commonly called the core. the shriveled remains of the sepals, style and stamens can sometimes be seen at the end of a pome opposite the stem, and the ovary is therefore often described as inferior in these flowers.
