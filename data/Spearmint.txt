the scientific name of spearmint is mentha spicata. spearmint or spear mint (mentha spicata) is a species of mint native to much of europe and southwest asia, though its exact natural range is uncertain due to extensive early cultivation.spearmint grows well in nearly all temperate climates. gardeners often grow it in pots or planters due to its invasive, spreading rhizomes. the plant prefers partial shade, but can flourish in full sun to mostly shade. spearmint is best suited to loamy soils with abundant organic material.spearmint leaves can be used fresh, dried, or frozen. they can also be preserved in salt, sugar, sugar syrup, alcohol, or oil. the leaves lose their aromatic appeal after the plant flowers. it can be dried by cutting just before, or right (at peak) as the flowers open, about one-half to three-quarters the way down the stalk (leaving smaller shoots room to grow). some dispute exists as to what drying method works best; some prefer different materials (such as plastic or cloth) and different lighting conditions (such as darkness or sunlight).spearmint is often cultivated for its aromatic and carminative oil, referred to as oil of spearmint. the most abundant compound in spearmint oil is r-(?)-carvone, which gives spearmint its distinctive smell. spearmint oil also contains significant amounts of limonene, dihydrocarvone, and 1,8-cineol. unlike peppermint oil, oil of spearmint contains minimal amounts of menthol and menthone. it is used as a flavoring for toothpaste and confectionery, and is sometimes added to shampoos and soaps.
