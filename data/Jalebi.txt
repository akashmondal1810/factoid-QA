Jalebi, also known as zulbia and zalabia, is an Indian sweet and popular food found all over South Asia and the Middle East. It is slightly large, chaotic pretzel. It is extremely common in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. It is made by deep-frying maida flour (plain flour or all-purpose flour) batter in pretzel or circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. They are particularly popular in the Indian subcontinent and Iran. This dessert can be served warm or cold. They have a somewhat chewy texture with a crystallized sugary exterior coating. Citric acid or lime juice is sometimes added to the syrup, as well as rose water. Jalebi is eaten with curd or rabri (North India) along with optional other flavours such as kewra (scented water). This dish is not to be confused with similar sweets and variants like imarti and chhena jalebi. It is mostly prepared on festivals like Diwali and Holi, though you can make it as per your mood and cravings.
