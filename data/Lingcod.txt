the scientific name of lingcod is ophiodon elongatus. the lingcod, ophiodon elongatus, or ling cod, is a fish of the greenling family hexagrammidae. it is the only extant member of the genus ophiodon. a slightly larger, extinct species, ophiodon ozymandias, is known from fossils from the late miocene of southern california.ophiodon elongatus is native to the north american west coast from shumagin islands in the gulf of alaska to baja california, mexico. it has been observed up to a size of 152 cm (60 in) and a weight of 59 kg (130 lbs). it is spotted in various shades of grey. the lingcod is a popular eating fish, and is thus prized by anglers. though not closely related to either ling or cod, the name "lingcod" originated because it somewhat resembles those fish. the lingcod's flesh is sometimes blue-green prior to cooking.
