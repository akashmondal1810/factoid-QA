the scientific name of cloudberry is rubus chamaemorus. rubus chamaemorus (greek chamai "on the ground", moros "mulberry") is a rhizomatous herb native to alpine and arctic tundra and boreal forest, producing amber-colored edible fruit similar to the raspberry or blackberry. english common names include cloudberry, bakeapple (in atlantic canada), knotberry and knoutberry (in england), aqpik or low-bush salmonberry (in alaska - not to be confused with true salmonberry, rubus spectabilis), and averin or evron (in scotland).unlike most rubus species, the cloudberry is dioecious, and fruit production by a female plant requires pollination from a male plant.the cloudberry grows to 10?25 cm high. the leaves alternate between having 5 and 7 soft, handlike lobes on straight, branchless stalks. after pollination, the white (sometimes reddish-tipped) flowers form raspberry-sized berries. encapsulating between 5 and 25 drupelets, each fruit is initially pale red, ripening into an amber color in early autumn.
