a tortilla chip is a snack food made from corn tortillas, which are cut into wedges and then fried (alternatively they may be discs pressed out of corn masa then fried or baked). corn tortillas are made of corn, vegetable oil, salt and water. though usually made of yellow corn, they can also be made of white, blue, or red corn. some manufacturers include many other ingredients including wheat and sugar and msg (monosodium glutamate, a common food additive).
