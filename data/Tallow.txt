tallow is a rendered form of beef or mutton fat, processed from suet. it is solid at room temperature. unlike suet, tallow can be stored for extended periods without the need for refrigeration to prevent decomposition, provided it is kept in an airtight container to prevent oxidation. in industry, tallow is not strictly defined as beef or mutton fat. in this context, tallow is animal fat that conforms to certain technical criteria, including its melting point. it is common for commercial tallow to contain fat derived from other animals, such as lard from pigs, or even from plant sources.
