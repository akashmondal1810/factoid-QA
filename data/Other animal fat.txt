animal fats and oils are lipid materials derived from animals. physically, oils are liquid at room temperature, and fats are solid. chemically, both fats and oils are composed of triglycerides. although many animal parts and secretions may yield oil, in commercial practice, oil is extracted primarily from rendered tissue fats obtained from livestock animals like pigs, chickens and cows. dairy products also yield popular animal fat and oil products such as cheese, butter, and milk.flesh and animal fat have a melting temperature of 184 ác, a boiling point of around 200 ác and an ignition point of 280 ác where it will burst into flames without spark. certain substances such as goose fat produce a higher smoke point than other animal fats, but are still lower than many vegetable oils such as olive or avocado.
