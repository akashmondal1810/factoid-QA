the scientific name of lichee is litchi chinensis. the lychee (litchi chinensis) (chinese: ??; pinyin: líå zh?) is the sole member of the genus litchi in the soapberry family, sapindaceae. it is a tropical and subtropical fruit tree native to the guangdong and fujian provinces of china, and now cultivated in many parts of the world. the fresh fruit has a "delicate, whitish pulp" with a floral smell and a fragrant, sweet flavor. since this perfume-like flavor is lost in the process of canning, the fruit is usually eaten fresh.
