the scientific name of norway lobster is nephrops norvegicus. nephrops norvegicus, known variously as the norway lobster, dublin bay prawn, langoustine (compare langostino) or scampi, is a slim, orange-pink lobster which grows up to 25 cm (10 in) long, and is "the most important commercial crustacean in europe". it is now the only extant species in the genus nephrops, after several other species were moved to the closely related genus metanephrops. it lives in the north-eastern atlantic ocean, and parts of the mediterranean sea, but is absent from the baltic sea and black sea. adults emerge from their burrows at night to feed on worms and fish.
