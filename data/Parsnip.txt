the scientific name of parsnip is pastinaca sativa. the parsnip is a root vegetable closely related to the carrot. it is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. its long tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh and can be left in the ground when mature as it becomes sweeter in flavour after winter frosts. in its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. if unharvested, it produces its flowering stem, topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, in its second growing season. by this time the stem is woody and the tuber inedible. the seeds are pale brown, flat and winged.
