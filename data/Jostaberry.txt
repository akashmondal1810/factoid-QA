the scientific name of jostaberry is ribes í nidigrolaria. the jostaberry is a complex-cross fruit bush in the ribes genus, involving three original species, the black currant r. nigrum, the north american coastal black gooseberry r. divaricatum, and the european gooseberry r. uva-crispa. it is similar to ribes í culverwellii, the jochelbeere, which is descended from just two of these species, r. nigrum and r. uva-crispa.the nearly black berry, which is smaller than a gooseberry and a bit larger than a blackcurrant, is edible both raw and cooked. it is described as having a taste intermediate between a gooseberry and a blackcurrant, with the gooseberry flavor more dominant in the unripe fruit, and the blackcurrant notes developing as the fruit ripens. the ripe fruit will hang on the bush in good condition through late summer, but is very popular with birds. the somewhat unripe fruit can be used in cooking recipes as a gooseberry. like blackcurrants the fruit freezes well, and like many other members of the ribes genus it is rich in vitamin c.
