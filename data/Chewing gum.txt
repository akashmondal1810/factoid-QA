chewing gum is a soft, cohesive substance intended for chewing but not swallowing. humans have used chewing gum for at least 3,000 years. modern chewing gum was originally made of chicle, a natural latex. by the 1960s, chicle was replaced by butadiene-based synthetic rubber which is cheaper to manufacture. most chewing gums are considered polymers.
