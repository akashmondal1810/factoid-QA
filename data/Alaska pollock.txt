the scientific name of alaska pollock is theragra chalcogramma. alaska pollock or walleye pollock (theragra chalcogramma) is a species of the cod family gadidae. alaska pollock is a semipelagic schooling fish widely distributed in the north pacific with largest concentrations found in the eastern bering sea. while related to the common atlantic pollock species of the same family, the alaska pollock is not a member of the same pollachius genus. rather, recent research suggests that it is more closely related to atlantic cod, and that alaska pollock should be moved back to genus gadus in which it was originally described as gadus chalcogrammus. furthermore, norwegian pollock (theragra finnmarchica), a rare fish of norwegian waters, is likely the same species as the alaska pollock.
