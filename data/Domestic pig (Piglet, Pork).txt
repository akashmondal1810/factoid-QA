the scientific name of domestic pig (piglet, pork) is sus scrofa domestica. the domestic pig is a large, domesticated, even-toed ungulate that traces its ancestry to the wild boar; it is considered a subspecies of the wild boar or a distinct species in its own right. their head plus body length ranges from 0.9 to 1.8 m (35 to 71 in) and adults can weigh between 50 to 350ækg (110 to 770ælb). compared to other artiodactyls, their head is relatively long, pointed, and free of warts. even-toed ungulates are generally herbivorous, although the domestic pig is an omnivore, like its wild ancestor. domestic pigs are farmed primarily for the consumption of their flesh, called pork. the animal's bones, hide, and bristles have been fashioned into items such as brushes. domestic pigs, especially the pot-bellied pig, are also kept as pets.
