the scientific name of beaver is castor canadensis. the beaver is a primarily nocturnal, large, semi-aquatic rodent. castor includes two extant species, north american beaver (castor canadensis) (native to north america) and eurasian beaver (castor fiber). beavers are known for building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). they are the second-largest rodent in the world. their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material. the north american beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6äóñ12 million. this population decline is due to extensive hunting for fur, for glands used as medicine and perfume, and because their harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with other land uses.
