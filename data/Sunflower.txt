the scientific name of sunflower is helianthus annuus. sunflower (helianthus annuus) is an annual plant native to the americas. it possesses a large inflorescence (flowering head), and its name is derived from the flower's shape and image, which is often used to depict the sun. the plant has a rough, hairy stem, broad, coarsely toothed, rough leaves and circular heads of flowers. the heads consist of many individual flowers which mature into seeds, often in the hundreds, on a receptacle base. from the americas, sunflower seeds were brought to europe in the 16th century, where, along with sunflower oil, they became a widespread cooking ingredient. leaves of the sunflower can be used as cattle feed, while the stems contain a fibre which may be used in paper production.
