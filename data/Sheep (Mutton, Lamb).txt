the scientific name of sheep (mutton, lamb) is ovis aries. sheep (ovis aries) are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. although the name "sheep" applies to many species in the genus ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to ovis aries. numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. an adult female sheep is referred to as a ewe (/ju?/), an intact male as a ram or occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a younger sheep as a lamb.domestic sheep are relatively small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral. domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic as a result of selective breeding by humans. a few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. polled), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.
