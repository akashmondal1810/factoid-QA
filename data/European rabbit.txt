the scientific name of european rabbit is oryctolagus. the european rabbit or common rabbit (oryctolagus cuniculus) is a species of rabbit native to southwestern europe (spain and portugal) and northwest africa (morocco and algeria). it has been widely introduced elsewhere, often with devastating effects on local biodiversity. however, its decline in its native range (caused by the diseases myxomatosis and rabbit calicivirus, as well as overhunting and habitat loss), has caused the decline of its highly dependent predators, the iberian lynx and the spanish imperial eagle. it is known as an invasive species because it has been introduced to countries on all continents with the exception of antarctica and sub-saharan africa, and caused many problems within the environment and ecosystems. australia has the most problems with european rabbits, due to the lack of natural predators there.the european rabbit is well known for digging networks of burrows, called warrens, where it spends most of its time when not feeding. unlike the related hares (lepus spp.), rabbits are altricial, the young being born blind and furless, in a fur-lined nest in the warren, and they are totally dependent upon their mother.
