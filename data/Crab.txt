the scientific name of crab is brachyura. crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder brachyura, which typically have a very short projecting "tail" (abdomen), usually entirely hidden under the thorax. they live in all the world's oceans, in fresh water, and on land, are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton and have a single pair of claws. many other animals with similar names ? such as hermit crabs, king crabs, porcelain crabs, horseshoe crabs and crab lice ? are not true crabs.
