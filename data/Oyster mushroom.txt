the scientific name of oyster mushroom is pleurotus ostreatus. pleurotus is a genus of gilled mushrooms which includes one of the most widely eaten mushrooms, p. ostreatus. species of pleurotus may be called oyster, abalone, or tree mushrooms, and are some of the most commonly cultivated edible mushrooms in the world. pleurotus fungi have been used in mycoremediation of pollutants such as petroleum and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.the caps may be laterally attached (with no stem). if there is a stem, it is normally eccentric and the gills are decurrent along it. the term pleurotoid is used for mushrooms having this general shape.the spores are smooth and elongated (described as "cylindrical"). where hyphae meet, they are joined by clamp connections. pleurotus is not considered to be a bracket fungus, and most of the species are monomitic (with a soft consistency). however, remarkably, pleurotus dryinus can sometimes be dimitic, meaning that it has additional skeletal hyphae, which give it a tougher consistency like bracket fungi.
