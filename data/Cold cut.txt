cold cuts (also known as lunch meats, luncheon meats, sandwich meats, cooked meats, sliced meats, cold meats and deli meats) are cheeses or precooked or cured meat, often sausages or meat loaves, that are sliced and usually served cold on sandwiches or on party trays. in commonwealth countries and the u.k., luncheon meat refers specifically to products that can include mechanically reclaimed meat (paste-like meat product produced by forcing beef, pork, turkey or chicken, under high pressure through a sieve or similar device to separate the bone from the edible meat tissue). in british english, the terms cold meats, cooked meats, or sliced meats are used instead.
