the scientific name of gadus (common cod) is gadus. gadus is a genus of demersal fish in the family gadidae, commonly known as cod, although there are additional cod species in other genera. until recently, three species in the genus were recognized. modern taxonomy also includes a fourth one, the alaska pollock (gadus chalcogrammus), which is not separate from the norway pollock. furthermore, greenland cod (g. ogac) is no longer considered a distinct species but rather a subspecies of pacific cod (g. macrocephalus).
