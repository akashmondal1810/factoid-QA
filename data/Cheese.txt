cheese is a food derived from milk that is produced in a wide range of flavors, textures, and forms by coagulation of the milk protein casein. it comprises proteins and fat from milk, usually the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. during production, the milk is usually acidified, and adding the enzyme rennet causes coagulation. the solids are separated and pressed into final form. some cheeses have molds on the rind or throughout. most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.
