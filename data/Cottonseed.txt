the scientific name of cottonseed is gossypium. cottonseed is the seed of the cotton plant (gossypium). the mature seeds are brown ovoids weighing about a tenth of a gram. by weight, they are 60% cotyledon, 32% coat and 8% embryonic root and shoot. these are 20% protein, 20% oil and 3.5% starch. fibres grow from the seed coat to form a boll of cotton lint. the boll is a protective fruit and when the plant is grown commercially, it is stripped from the seed by ginning and the lint is then processed into cotton fibre. for every hundred weight of fibre, about one hundred and sixty weight of seeds are produced. the seeds are about 15% of the value of the crop and are pressed to make oil and used as animal feed. about 5% of the seeds are used to sow the next crop.
