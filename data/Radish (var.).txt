the scientific name of radish (var.) is raphanus sativus var. sativus. the radish (<i>raphanus raphanistrum</i> subsp. <i>sativus</i>) is an edible root vegetable of the brassicaceae family that was domesticated in europe in pre-roman times. radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. they have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, and length of time they take to mature. radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. they are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. they germinate quickly and grow rapidly, smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months. another use of radish is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a forage crop. some radishes are grown for their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be grown for oil production. others are used for sprouting.
