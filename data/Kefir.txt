kefir (alternately kef?rs, keefir, kephir, kewra, talai, mudu kekiya, milkkefir, b√≠_lgaros) is a fermented milk drink that originated with shepherds of the north caucasus region, who discovered that fresh milk carried in leather pouches would occasionally ferment into an effervescent beverage. it is prepared by inoculating cow, goat, or sheep's milk with kefir grains. traditional kefir was made in skin bags that were hung near a doorway; the bag would be knocked by anyone passing through the doorway to help keep the milk and kefir grains well mixed.
