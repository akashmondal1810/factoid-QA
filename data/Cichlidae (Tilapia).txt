the scientific name of cichlidae (tilapia) is cichlidae. tilapia is the common name for nearly a hundred species of cichlid fish from the tilapiine cichlid tribe. tilapia inhabit a variety of fresh water habitats, including shallow streams, ponds, rivers and lakes. because of their large size, rapid growth, and palatability, tilapiine cichlids are the focus of major farming efforts, specifically various species of oreochromis, sarotherodon, and tilapia, collectively known colloquially as tilapia. like other large fish, they are a good source of protein and popular among artisanal and commercial fisheries.
