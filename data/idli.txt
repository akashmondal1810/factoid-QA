Idli or idly are a type of savoury rice cake, originating from the Indian subcontinent, popular as breakfast foods in southern India and among Tamils in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming a batter consisting of fermented black lentils (de-husked) and rice. The fermentation process breaks down the starches so that they are more readily metabolized by the body.
