a burrito, or taco de harina, is a type of mexican food. it consists of a wheat flour tortilla wrapped or folded around a filling. the flour tortilla is usually lightly grilled or steamed, to soften it and make it more pliable. in mexico, refried beans or meat are sometimes the only fillings. in the united states, however, fillings generally include a combination of ingredients such as mexican-style rice or plain rice, refried beans or beans, lettuce, salsa, meat, avocado, cheese, and sour cream, and the size varies, with some burritos considerably larger than their mexican counterparts.
