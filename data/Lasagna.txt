lasagne are a wide, flat pasta shape, and possibly one of the oldest types of pasta. the word also refers to a dish made with several layers of lasagne sheets alternated with sauces and various other ingredients.lasagne originated in italy, traditionally ascribed to the city of bologna (emilia-romagna), where the first modern recipe was created and published and became a traditional dish. traditional lasagne is made by interleaving layers of pasta with layers of sauce, made with rag√≠_, bechamel, and parmigiano-reggiano. in other regions and outside of italy it is common to find lasagne made with ricotta or mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, various meats (e.g., ground beef, pork or chicken), miscellaneous vegetables (e.g., spinach, zucchini, mushrooms) and typically flavored with wine, garlic, onion, and oregano. in all cases the lasagne are oven-baked.
