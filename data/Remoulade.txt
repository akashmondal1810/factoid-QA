remoulade or rí©moulade, invented in france, is a popular condiment in many countries. very much like the tartar sauce of some english-speaking cultures, remoulade is often aioli- or mayonnaise-based. although similar to tartar sauce, it is often more yellowish (or reddish in louisiana), often flavored with curry, and sometimes contains chopped pickles or piccalilli. it can also contain horseradish, paprika, anchovies, capers and a host of other items. while its original purpose was possibly for serving with meats, it is now more often used as an accompaniment to seafood dishes, especially pan-fried breaded fish fillets and seafood cakes.
