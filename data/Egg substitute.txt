for those who do not consume eggs, alternatives used in baking include other rising agents or binding materials, such as ground flax seeds or potato starch flour. tofu can also act as a partial binding agent, since it is high in lecithin due to its soy content. applesauce can be used, as well as arrowroot and banana. extracted soybean lecithin, in turn, is often used in packaged foods as an inexpensive substitute for egg-derived lecithin.other egg substitutes are made from just the white of the egg for those who worry about the high cholesterol and fat content in eggs. these products usually have added vitamins and minerals, as well as vegetable-based emulsifiers and thickeners such as xanthan gum or guar gum. these allow the product to maintain the nutrition and several culinary properties of real eggs, making possible foods such as hollandaise sauce, custard, mayonnaise, and most baked goods with these substitutes.
