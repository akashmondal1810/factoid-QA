the scientific name of wild rice is zizania. wild rice (also called canada rice, indian rice, and water oats) are four species of grasses forming the genus zizania, and the grain which can be harvested from them. the grain was historically gathered and eaten in both north america and china. while it is now a delicacy in north america, the grain is eaten less in china, where the plant's stem is used as a vegetable.wild rice is not directly related to asian rice (oryza sativa), whose wild progenitors are o. rufipogon and o. nivara, although they are close cousins, sharing the tribe oryzeae. wild rice grains have a chewy outer sheath with a tender inner grain that has a slightly vegetal taste.the plants grow in shallow water in small lakes and slow-flowing streams; often, only the flowering head of wild rice rises above the water. the grain is eaten by dabbling ducks and other aquatic wildlife, as well as humans.
