marzipan is a confection consisting primarily of sugar or honey and almond meal, sometimes augmented with almond oil or extract. it is often made into sweets; common uses are marzipan-filled chocolate and small marzipan imitations of fruits and vegetables. it is also rolled into thin sheets and glazed for icing cakes, primarily birthday and wedding cakes and christmas cakes. this use is particularly common in england, on large fruitcakes. marzipan may also be used as a cake ingredient, as in stollen. in some countries, it is shaped into small figures of animals as a traditional treat for new year's day. marzipan is also used in tortell, and in some versions of king cake eaten during the carnival season. traditional swedish princess cake is typically covered with a layer of marzipan that has been tinted pale green.
