the scientific name of gooseberry is ribes uva-crispa. the gooseberry (with scientific names ribes uva-crispa, is a species of ribes . it is native to europe, northwestern africa, west, south and southeast asia. gooseberry bushes produce an edible fruit and are grown on both a commercial and domestic basis. although usually placed as a subgenus within ribes, a few taxonomists treat grossularia as a separate genus, although hybrids between gooseberry and blackcurrant are possible. the subgenus grossularia differs somewhat from currants, chiefly in their spiny stems, and in that their flowers grow one to three together on short stems, not in racemes. it is one of several similar species in the subgenus grossularia; for the other related species, see the genus page ribes.
