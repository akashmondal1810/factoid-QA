the scientific name of cherimoya is annona cherimola. the cherimoya, also spelled chirimoya, is the fruit of the species annona cherimola, which generally is thought to be native to the andes, although an alternative hypothesis proposes central america as the origin of cherimoya because many of its wild relatives occur in this area. today cherimoya is grown throughout south asia, central america, south america, southern california and southern andalucia [la axarquia].
