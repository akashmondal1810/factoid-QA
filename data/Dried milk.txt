powdered milk is a manufactured dairy product made by evaporating milk to dryness. one purpose of drying milk is to preserve it; milk powder has a far longer shelf life than liquid milk and does not need to be refrigerated, due to its low moisture content. another purpose is to reduce its bulk for economy of transportation. powdered milk and dairy products include such items as dry whole milk, nonfat dry milk, dry buttermilk, dry whey products and dry dairy blends.
