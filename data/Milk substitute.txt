a milk substitute is a liquid that replaces milk in a diet or recipe. this overlaps with but is distinct from the group of milk-like liquids called "milks" because of their similarity to the liquid produced by mammary glands.lactose intolerance or a milk allergy can prompt the use of milk substitutes; they are also commonly consumed by vegans. some milk substitutes are marketed to consumers as being more healthy than cow's milk, by being lower in saturated fat and for not containing cholesterol. when milk substitutes are lacking in vitamins or dietary minerals present in milk (such as vitamin b12 or calcium), they are sometimes fortified.the two most common categories of milk substitutes are grain milk and plant milk. the most common grain milk is rice milk, while the most common plant milk is soy milk. other examples include hemp milk, coconut milk, almond milk, and peanut milk. gluten-free milk substitutes are also available.
