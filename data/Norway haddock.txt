the scientific name of norway haddock is sebastes viviparus. the rose fish (sebastes norvegicus), also known as the ocean perch, atlantic redfish, norway haddock, red perch, red bream, golden redfish, or hemdurgan, is a species of rockfish from the north atlantic. misleadingly, it is sometimes called bergylt, bream, or snapper, though it is unrelated to all of these. in the past, the scientific name sebastes marinus was frequently used, but this is actually a synonym of serranus scriba.this food fish lives off the coasts of europe and north america. adults are found off the coast at depths of 100 to 1,000 m (330 to 3,280 ft); juveniles may be found in coastal waters such as fjords. the adults are slow-moving, gregarious fish, of some commercial importance. they reach 1 m (3 ft 3 in), though most only are about half that length. they are viviparous. while the young fish are of brownish color, the adults are bright red.
