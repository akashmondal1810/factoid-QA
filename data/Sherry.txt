sherry is a fortified wine made from white grapes that are grown near the town of jerez de la frontera in andalusia, spain. sherry is produced in a variety of dry styles made primarily from the palomino grape, ranging from light versions similar to white table wines, such as manzanilla and fino, to darker and heavier versions that have been allowed to oxidise as they age in barrel, such as amontillado and oloroso. sweet dessert wines are also made, from pedro ximenez or moscatel grapes, and are sometimes blended with palomino-based sherries.
