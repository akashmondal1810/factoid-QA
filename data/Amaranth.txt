the scientific name of amaranth is amaranthus. amaranthus, collectively known as amaranth,[citation needed] is a cosmopolitan genus of annual or short-lived perennial plants. catkin-like cymes of densely packed flowers grow in summer or autumn. approximately 60 species are recognized, with inflorescences and foliage ranging from purple and red to green or gold. members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus celosia.although several species are often considered weeds, people around the world value amaranths as leaf vegetables, cereals, and ornamental plants."amaranth" derives from greek ????????? (amarantos), "unfading," with the greek word for "flower," ????? (anthos), factoring into the word's development as "amaranth." the more accurate "amarant" is an archaic variant.
