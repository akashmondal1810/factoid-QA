the scientific name of allspice is pimenta dioica. allspice, also called jamaica pepper, pepper, myrtle pepper, pimenta, pimento, english pepper or newspice, is the dried unripe fruit ("berries", used as a spice) of pimenta dioica, a midcanopy tree native to the greater antilles, southern mexico, and central america, now cultivated in many warm parts of the world. the name 'allspice' was coined as early as 1621 by the english, who thought it combined the flavour of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.several unrelated fragrant shrubs are called "carolina allspice" (calycanthus floridus), "japanese allspice" (chimonanthus praecox), or "wild allspice" (lindera benzoin). allspice is also sometimes used to refer to the herb costmary (tanacetum balsamita).
