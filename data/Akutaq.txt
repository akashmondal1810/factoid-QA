akutaq or agutak, also known as eskimo ice cream, is a common food in western alaska, consisting of whipped fat mixed with berries, with optional additions such as fish and sugar. the word comes from yupik and means "something mixed". there are many variations of akutaq, but most are based around mixing berries, meat, leaves, or roots with animal oil or fat (these are now often replaced by crisco). cranberries, salmonberries, crowberries, cloudberries, and blueberries are common fruits. salmon and caribou are common meats. reindeer tallow, moose tallow, walrus tallow, caribou tallow, or seal oil can be used. sugar is sometimes added (although not traditionally). occasionally, extra water is needed as well.
