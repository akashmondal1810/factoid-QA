the scientific name of orange roughy is hoplostethus atlanticus. the orange roughy, red roughy, slimehead or deep sea perch, hoplostethus atlanticus, is a relatively large deep-sea fish belonging to the slimehead family (trachichthyidae). the marine conservation society has categorized orange roughy as vulnerable to exploitation. it is found in 3 to 9 ác (37æto 48æáf) deep (bathypelagic, 180 to 1,800 metres waters of the western pacific ocean, eastern atlantic ocean, indo-pacific, and in the eastern pacific off chile. the orange roughy is notable for its extraordinary lifespan, with lifespans up to 149 years determined by scientific methods. it is important to commercial deep trawl fisheries. the fish is actually a bright, brick red color; however, the orange roughy fades to a yellowish orange after death. like other slimeheads, the orange roughy is slow-growing and late to mature, resulting in a very low resilience. they are extremely susceptible to overfishing because of this, and many stocks have already crashed; recently discovered substitute stocks are rapidly dwindling. the flesh is firm with a mild flavour; it is sold skinned and filleted, fresh or frozen.
