the scientific name of date is phoenix dactylifera. phoenix dactylifera (date, or date palm) is a palm in the genus phoenix, cultivated for its edible sweet fruit. the fruit is known as a date. the fruit's english name (through old french), as well as the latin species name dactylifera, both come from the greek word for "finger", díçktulos, because of the fruit's elongated shape. dates are oval-cylindrical, 3?7 cm long, and 2?3 cm (0.79?1.18 in) diameter, and when ripe, range from bright red to bright yellow in colour, depending on variety. dates contain a single stone about 2?2.5 cm (0.79?0.98 in) long and 6?8 mm (0.24?0.31 in) thick. three main cultivar groups of date exist: soft (e.g. 'barhee', 'halawy', 'khadrawy', 'medjool'), semi-dry (e.g. 'dayri', 'deglet noor', 'zahdi'), and dry (e.g. 'thoory'). the type of fruit depends on the glucose, fructose and sucrose content.dry or soft dates are eaten out-of-hand, or may be pitted and stuffed with fillings such as almonds, walnuts, pecans, candied orange and lemon peel, tahini, marzipan or cream cheese.
