frozen dessert is the generic name for desserts made by freezing liquids, semi-solids, and sometimes even solids. they may be based on flavored water (shave ice, sorbet, snow cones, etc.), on fruit purí©es (such as sorbet), on milk and cream (most ice creams), on custard (frozen custard and some ice creams), on mousse (semifreddo), and others.in some countries including canada, the term is often used on products which are similar in taste and texture to ice cream, but which do not meet the legal definition of that term (often being made primarily with vegetable oils, i.e. mellorine, as opposed to milk or cream).
