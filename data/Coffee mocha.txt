a caffíâ mocha is a variant of a caffíâ latte. like a caffe latte, it is based on espresso and hot milk, but with added chocolate, typically in the form of sweet cocoa powder, although many varieties use chocolate syrup. mochas can contain dark or milk chocolate. mocha is also used to describe a type of coffee bean. smaller and rounder than most other varieties, these beans are derived from the coffee species coffea arabica; "mocha coffee" can refer either to the coffee-with-chocolate drink, or simply to coffee brewed with mocha beans.
