ymer is a danish soured milk product which has been known since 1930. it is made by fermenting whole milk with the bacterial culture lactococcus lactis. when producing fermented milk products such as yogurt, ymer, filmjí_lk, skyr, qvark and a-38, and also when producing cheese, one can add lactic acid bacteria which convert milk sugar in the milk into lactic acid and other substances. acidity makes the milk thicker, gives it a tart flavor, and increases the shelf life by several days.unlike other fermented milk products, ymer is drained of its whey. that means that ymer has a higher content of solids, including protein, while the fat content stays at 3.5% as in whole milk.ymer is used in breakfasts, snacks, desserts, dressings and baking. the traditional breakfast topping is ymerdrys ("ymer sprinkle"), which is a mix of rugbríd breadcrumbs and brown sugar. 1 deciliter of ymer contains 146 kj (35 kilocalories).
