the scientific name of kohlrabi is brassica oleracea var. gongylodes. kohlrabi (german turnip or turnip cabbage) (brassica oleracea gongylodes group) (olkopi in assamese and bengali) (monji haak in kashmiri) is an annual vegetable, and is a low, stout cultivar of cabbage. kohlrabi can be eaten raw as well as cooked.kohlrabi stems are surrounded by two distinct fibrous layers that do not soften appreciably when cooked. these layers are generally peeled away prior to cooking or serving raw, with the result that the stems often provide a smaller amount of food than one might assume from their intact appearance.the kohlrabi root is frequently used raw in salad or slaws. it has a texture similar to that of a broccoli stem, but with a flavor that is sweeter and less vegetal.kohlrabi leaves are edible and can be used interchangeably with collard and kale.kohlrabi is an important part of the kashmiri diet and one of the most commonly cooked foods. it is prepared with its leaves and served with a light gravy and eaten with rice.some varieties are grown as feed for cattle.
