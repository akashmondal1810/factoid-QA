ice cream (derived from earlier iced cream or cream ice) is a frozen dessert usually made from dairy products, such as milk and cream and often combined with fruits or other ingredients and flavours. most varieties contain sugar, although some are made with other sweeteners. in some cases, artificial flavourings and colourings are used in addition to, or instead of, the natural ingredients. the mixture of chosen ingredients is stirred slowly while cooling, in order to incorporate air and to prevent large ice crystals from forming. the result is a smoothly textured semi-solid foam that is malleable and can be scooped.
