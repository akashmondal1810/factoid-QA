the scientific name of sablefish is anoplopoma fimbria. the sablefish, anoplopoma fimbria, is one of two members of the fish family anoplopomatidae and the only species in the anoplopoma genus. in english, common names for it include sable (usa), black cod (usa, uk, canada), blue cod (uk), bluefish (uk), candlefish (uk), coal cod (uk), coalfish (canada), beshow, and skil(fish) (canada), although many of these names also refer to other, unrelated, species. in the usa, the fda accepts only "sablefish" as the acceptable market name; "black cod" is considered a vernacular (regional) name and should not be used as a statement of identity for this species. the sablefish is found in muddy sea beds in the north pacific at depths of 300 to 2,700 m (1000 to 9000 ft) and is commercially important to japan.the white flesh of the sablefish is soft-textured and mildly flavored. it is considered a delicacy in many countries. when cooked, its flaky texture is similar to patagonian toothfish (chilean sea bass). the meat has a high fat content and can be prepared in many ways, including grilling, smoking, or frying, or served as sushi. sablefish flesh is high in long-chain omega 3 fatty acids, epa and dha. it contains about as much as wild salmon.
