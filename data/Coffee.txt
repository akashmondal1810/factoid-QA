the scientific name of coffee is coffea. coffee is a brewed beverage prepared from the roasted or baked seeds of several species of an evergreen shrub of the genus coffea. the two most common sources of coffee beans are the highly regarded coffea arabica, and the "robusta" form of the hardier coffea canephora. the latter is resistant to the coffee leaf rust (hemileia vastatrix), but has a more bitter taste. coffee plants are cultivated in more than 70 countries, primarily in equatorial latin america, southeast asia, and africa. once ripe, coffee "berries" are picked, processed and dried to yield the seeds inside. the seeds are then roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee.
