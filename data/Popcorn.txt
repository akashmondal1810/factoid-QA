popcorn, or popping corn, is corn (maize) which expands from the kernel and puffs up when heated. corn is able to pop because, like sorghum, quinoa and millet, its kernels have a hard moisture-sealed hull and a dense starchy interior. this allows pressure to build inside the kernel until an explosive "pop" results. some strains of corn are now cultivated specifically as popping corns.
