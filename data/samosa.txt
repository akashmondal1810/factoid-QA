A samosa is a fried or baked pastry with a savoury filling, such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, meat, or lentils. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region. The Indian style, often accompanied by a chutney, is probably the most widely-known of a broad family of recipes from Africa to China, which have origins in medieval times or earlier. Samosas are a popular entr√©e, appetizer, or snack in the local cuisines of the Indian subcontinent, Western Asia, Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean, and Africa. Due to emigration and cultural diffusion from these areas, samosas in today's world are also prepared in other regions. Samosa is certainly the most popular snack of India, which can be prepared very easily at home with some very simple ingredients at home.
