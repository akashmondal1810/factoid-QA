the scientific name of kiwi is actinidia chinensis. the kiwifruit, often shortened to kiwi in many parts of the world, is the edible berry of a woody vine in the genus actinidia. the most common cultivar group of kiwifruit ('hayward') is oval, about the size of a large hen's egg (5?8 centimetres in length and 4.5?5.5 centimetres in diameter). it has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin and bright green or golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. the fruit has a soft texture and a sweet but unique flavor, and today is a commercial crop in several countries, such as italy, new zealand, chile, greece and france.
