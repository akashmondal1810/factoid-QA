the scientific name of leek is allium porrum. the leek is a vegetable that belongs, along with onion and garlic, to the genus allium, currently placed in family amaryllidaceae, subfamily allioideae. historically many scientific names were used for leeks, which are now treated as cultivars of allium ampeloprasum. two related vegetables, elephant garlic and kurrat, are also cultivars of a. æampeloprasum, although different in their uses as food. the edible part of the leek plant is a bundle of leaf sheaths that is sometimes erroneously called a stem or stalk.
