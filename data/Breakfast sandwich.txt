a breakfast sandwich is a sandwich served for breakfast at fast food restaurants and delis or bought as a fast ready to heat and eat sandwich from a store. breakfast sandwiches can also be made from scratch in the home. breakfast sandwiches typically are made using breakfast meats (which are e.g. spam, sausages, patty sausages, bacon, country ham and pork roll), breads, eggs and cheese. these sandwiches were typically regional specialties until fast food restaurants began serving breakfast. because the types of bread common, such as biscuits, bagels, and english muffins were similar in size to a fast food hamburger buns, they made an obvious choice for fast food restaurants. unlike other breakfast items, they were perfect for the innovation of the drive-through. these sandwiches have also become a staple of many convenience stores, that serve them as take-away items.
