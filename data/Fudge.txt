fudge is a type of western confectionery which is usually very sweet, and extremely rich. it is made by mixing sugar, butter, and milk and heating it to the soft-ball stage at 240 áf (116 ác), and then beating the mixture while it cools so that it acquires a smooth, creamy consistency. many variations with other flavourings added are possible.
