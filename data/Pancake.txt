a pancake is a thin, flat, round cake prepared from a batter, and cooked on a hot griddle or frying pan. most pancakes are quick breads; some use a yeast-raised or fermented batter. most pancakes are cooked one side on a griddle and flipped partway through to cook the other side. depending on the region, pancakes may be served at any time, with a variety of toppings or fillings including jam, chocolate chips, fruit, syrup or meat.
