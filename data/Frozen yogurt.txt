frozen yogurt (also known as frozen yoghurt or by the tradenames froyo and frogurt) is a frozen dessert containing yogurt or other dairy products. it is slightly more tart than ice cream, as well as lower in fat (due to the use of milk instead of cream). frozen yogurt usually consists of milk solids, some kind of sweetener, milk fat, yogurt culture, coloring, and flavoring. frozen yogurt has come to be used much like ice cream, and is served in a wide variety of flavors and styles.
