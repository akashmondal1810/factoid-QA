A dosa is a cooked flat thin layered rice batter, originating from the South India, made from a fermented batter. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black gwhram ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt. Dosas are a typical part of the Southern Indian and Sri Lankan Tamil diets, but the dish is now popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, dosas are served hot along with sambhar, a stuffing of potatoes, and chutney. They can be consumed with idli podi as well.
