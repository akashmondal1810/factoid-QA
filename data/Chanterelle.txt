the scientific name of chanterelle is cantharellus cibarius. cantharellus cibarius, commonly known as the chanterelle, golden chanterelle or girolle, is a fungus. it is probably the best known species of the genus cantharellus, if not the entire family of cantharellaceae. it is orange or yellow, meaty and funnel-shaped. on the lower surface, underneath the smooth cap, it has gill-like ridges that run almost all the way down its stipe, which tapers down seamlessly from the cap. it has a fruity smell, reminiscent of apricots and a mildly peppery taste (hence its german name, pfifferling) and is considered an excellent edible mushroom.
