the molluscs or mollusks compose the large phylum of invertebrate animals known as the mollusca. around 85,000 extant species of molluscs are recognized. molluscs are the largest marine phylum, comprising about 23% of all the named marine organisms. numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. they are highly diverse, not only in size and in anatomical structure, but also in behaviour and in habitat. the phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, are among the most neurologically advanced of all invertebrates?and either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. the gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total. molluscs have been and still are an important food source for anatomically modern humans, but with a risk of food poisoning from toxins that accumulate in molluscs under certain conditions, and many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. molluscs have, for centuries, also been the source of important luxury goods, notably pearls, mother of pearl, tyrian purple dye, and sea silk. their shells have also been used as money in some preindustrial societies.
