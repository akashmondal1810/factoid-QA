sake, also known as nihonshu, is a rice-based alcoholic beverage of japanese origin. sake is also referred to in english as a form of rice wine. however, unlike true wine, in which alcohol is produced by fermenting the sugar naturally present in fruit, sake is made through a brewing process more like that of beer, thus it is more like a rice brew than a rice wine.
