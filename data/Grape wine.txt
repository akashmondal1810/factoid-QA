wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes or other fruits. the natural chemical balance of grapes lets them ferment without the addition of sugars, acids, enzymes, water, or other nutrients. yeast consumes the sugars in the grapes and converts them into alcohol and carbon dioxide. different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts produce different styles of wine. the well-known variations result from the very complex interactions between the biochemical development of the fruit, reactions involved in fermentation, terroir and subsequent appellation, along with human intervention in the overall process.
