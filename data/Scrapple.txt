scrapple, also known by the pennsylvania dutch name pon haus, is traditionally a mush of pork scraps and trimmings combined with cornmeal and flour, often buckwheat flour, and spices. the mush is formed into a semi-solid congealed loaf, and slices of the scrapple are then panfried before serving. scraps of meat left over from butchering, not used or sold elsewhere, were made into scrapple to avoid waste. scrapple is best known as a rural american food of the mid-atlantic states (delaware, pennsylvania, new jersey, and maryland). scrapple and pon haus are commonly considered an ethnic food of the pennsylvania dutch, including the mennonites and amish.
