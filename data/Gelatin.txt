gelatin is a translucent, colorless, brittle (when dry), flavorless solid substance, derived from the collagen inside animals' skin and bones. it is commonly used as a gelling agent in food. it is found in some gummy candies as well as other products such as marshmallows, gelatin dessert, and some low-fat yogurt. household gelatin comes in the form of sheets, granules, or powder. instant types can be added to the food as they are; others need to be soaked in water beforehand.
