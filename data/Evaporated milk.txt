evaporated milk, also known as dehydrated milk, is a shelf-stable canned milk product with about 60% of the water removed from fresh milk. it differs from sweetened condensed milk, which contains added sugar. sweetened condensed milk requires less processing since the added sugar inhibits bacterial growth. evaporated milk should not be confused with condensed milk, dry milk, or powdered milk.
