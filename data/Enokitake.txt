the scientific name of enokitake is flammulina velutipes. enokitake is a long, thin white mushroom used in east asian cuisine (such as that of china, japan and korea). these mushrooms are cultivars of flammulina velutipes, also known by the name, golden needle mushroom or lily mushroom. wild forms differing in color, texture, and sliminess are called winter mushrooms, velvet foot or velvet stem, amongst other names.this mushroom is available fresh or canned, with experts recommending fresh enoki specimens with firm, white, shiny caps, rather than those with slimy or brownish stalks that are best avoided.[citation needed] it is traditionally used for soups, but can also be used for salads and other dishes. the mushroom has a crisp texture and can be refrigerated for approximately one week.
