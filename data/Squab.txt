the scientific name of squab is columba. in culinary terminology, squab is a young domestic pigeon or its meat. the meat is widely described as tasting like dark chicken. the term is probably of scandinavian origin; the swedish word skvabb means "loose, fat flesh". it formerly applied to all dove and pigeon species, such as the wood pigeon, the mourning dove, and the now-extinct passenger pigeon, and their meat. more recently, squab meat comes almost entirely from domesticated pigeons. the meat of dove and pigeon gamebirds hunted primarily for sport is rarely called squab.
