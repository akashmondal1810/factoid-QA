the scientific name of common oregano is origanum vulgare. oregano (scientific name origanum vulgare) is a common species of origanum, a genus of the mint family (lamiaceae). it is native to warm-temperate western and southwestern eurasia and the mediterranean region.oregano is an important culinary herb, used for the flavour of its leaves, which can be more flavourful when dried than fresh. it has an aromatic, warm and slightly bitter taste, which can vary in intensity. good quality oregano may be strong enough almost to numb the tongue, but the cultivars adapted to colder climates often have a lesser flavor. factors such as climate, seasons and soil composition may affect the aromatic oils present, and this effect may be greater than the differences between the various species of plants. among the chemical compounds contributing to the flavour are carvacrol, thymol, limonene, pinene, ocimene, and caryophyllene
