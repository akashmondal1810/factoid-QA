dripping, also known usually as beef dripping or more rarely as pork dripping, is an animal fat produced from the fatty or otherwise unusable parts of cow or pig carcasses. it is similar to lard and tallow although tallow is an unacceptable flavor for shortening or cooking generally. it is used for cooking, especially in british cuisine, significantly so in northern england, though towards the end of the 20th century dripping fell out of favor due to it being regarded as less healthy than vegetable oils such as olive or sunflower.
