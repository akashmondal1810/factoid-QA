processed cheese is a food product made from normal cheese and sometimes other unfermented dairy ingredients, plus emulsifiers, extra salt, food colorings, or whey. due to the processing and additives, some softer varieties cannot legally be labeled as "cheese" in many countries, including the united states and united kingdom, and so are sold as "cheese food", "cheese spread", or "cheese product", depending primarily on the amount of cheese, moisture, and milkfat present in the final product. the best known processed cheese in the united states is marketed as american cheese by kraft foods, borden, and other companies.
