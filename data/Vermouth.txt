vermouth is an aromatized fortified wine flavored with various botanicals (roots, barks, flowers, seeds, herbs, spices). the modern versions of the beverage were first produced in 1757 in turin, italy. vermouth was consumed as a medicinal libation until the later 19th century when it became an important ingredient in many of the first classic cocktails, such as the martini, the manhattan, and the negroni. in addition to being consumed as an aperitif or cocktail ingredient, vermouth is sometimes used as a substitute for white wine in cooking. historically, there have been two main types of vermouth, sweet and dry. recently, however, vermouth manufacturers have begun experimenting and have created various styles, including white or bianco, amber, and rose. vermouth is produced by starting with a base of a neutral grape wine. each manufacturer adds additional alcohol and a proprietary mixture of dry ingredients, consisting of aromatic herbs, roots, and barks, to the base wine. after the wine is aromatized and fortified, the vermouth is sweetened with either cane sugar or caramel, depending on the style. italian and french companies produce most of the vermouth consumed throughout the world.
