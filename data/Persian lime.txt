the scientific name of persian lime is citrus latifolia. persian lime (citrus ílatifolia) or shiraz limoo also known as tahiti lime or bearss lime (named after john t. bearss, who developed this seedless variety about 1895 in his nursery at porterville, california), is a citrus fruit related to the standard lime. it has a nearly thornless tree. the persian lime is of hybrid origin, most likely from a cross between key lime (citrus aurantiifolia) and either lemon (citrus ílimon) or citron (citrus medica).it has a uniquely fragrant, spicy aroma. the fruit is about 6 centimetres (2.4 in) in diameter, often with slightly nippled ends, and is usually sold while green, although it yellows as it reaches full ripeness. it is also widely available dried, as it is often used this way in persian cooking. it is larger, thicker-skinned, with less intense citrus aromatics than the key lime (citrus aurantifolia).
