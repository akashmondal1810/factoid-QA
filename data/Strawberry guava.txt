the scientific name of strawberry guava is psidium cattleianum. psidium cattleianum, named in honour of notable english horticulturist william cattley, commonly known as cattley guava or peruvian guava, is a small tree (2?6 m tall), bearing small red or yellow fruit, which are somewhat sour but sometimes eaten or made into jam. the red-fruited variety, psidium littorale var. longipes, is known as strawberry guava; the yellow-fruited variety, psidium littorale var. littorale (lucidum) is variously known as lemon guava, ""yellow-fruited cherry guava"", and in hawaii as waiaw? and is usually smaller. native to brazil and adjacent tropical south america, it is closely related to common guava (p. guajava), and like that species is a widespread, highly invasive species in tropical areas, especially hawai?i. it tends to form dense, monotypic stands which prevent regrowth of native species, and is very difficult to eradicate; it also provides refuge for fruit flies which cause extensive agricultural damage. as an invasive species, it is sometimes erroneously called chinese guava. cherry guava is sporadically naturalised in coastal areas of queensland and northern new south wales. it is also naturalised on lord howe island, norfolk island and christmas island (navie 2004; queensland herbarium 2008).the yellow variety bears even more heavily than the red and generally has larger fruit. the fruit can be eaten whole as both the thin skin and soft, juicy interior are edible. strawberry guavas taste like a passionfruit mixed with strawberry; the yellow variety lacks the astringency of the red and is preferred by some people.  the skin is also edible and tastes a bit like rose petals but is often removed for a sweeter flavour. the seeds are small and white in colour and can be roasted as a substitute for coffee. its leaves may be brewed for tea.
