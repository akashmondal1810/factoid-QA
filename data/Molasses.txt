molasses is a viscous by-product of the processing of sugar cane, grapes or sugar beets into sugar. the quality of molasses depends on the maturity of the sugar cane or sugar beet, the amount of sugar extracted, and the method of extraction. sweet sorghum syrup is known in some parts of the united states as molasses, though it is not true molasses.
