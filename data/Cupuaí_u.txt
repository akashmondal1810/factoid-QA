the scientific name of cupuaí_u is theobroma grandiflorum. cupuaí_u (also spelled cupuassu, cupuazí_, and copoasu), is a tropical rainforest tree related to cacao. common throughout the amazon basin, it is widely cultivated in the jungles of colombia, bolivia and peru and in the north of brazil, with the largest production in paríç, followed by amazonas, rondíçnia and acre. the white pulp of the cupuaí_u is uniquely fragrant (described as a mix of chocolate and pineapple), and it contains theacrine (1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric acid) instead of the xanthines (caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline) found in cacao. it is frequently used in desserts, juices and sweets. the juice tastes primarily like a pear, with a hint of banana.
