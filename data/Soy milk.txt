soy milk is a beverage made from soybeans. a stable emulsion of oil, water, and protein, it is produced by soaking dry soybeans and grinding them with water. soy milk contains about the same proportion of protein as cow's milk: around 3.5%; also 2% fat, 2.9% carbohydrate, and 0.5% ash. the coagulated protein from soy milk can be made into tofu, just as dairy milk can be made into cheese.
