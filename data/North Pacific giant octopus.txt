the scientific name of north pacific giant octopus is enteroctopus dofleini. enteroctopus dofleini, also known as the giant pacific octopus or north pacific giant octopus, is a large cephalopod belonging to the genus enteroctopus. it can be found in the coastal north pacific, usually at a depth of around 65æm (215æft). it can, however, live in much shallower or much deeper waters. it is arguably the largest octopus species, based on a scientific record of a 71ækg (156ælb) individual weighed live. the alternative contender is the seven-arm octopus (haliphron atlanticus) based on a 61ækg (134ælb) carcass estimated to have a live mass of 75ækg (165ælb). however, a number of questionable size records would suggest e. dofleini is the largest of all octopus species by a considerable margin.
