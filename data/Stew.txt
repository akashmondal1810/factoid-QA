a stew is a combination of solid food ingredients that have been cooked in liquid and served in the resultant gravy. ingredients in a stew can include any combination of vegetables (such as carrots, potatoes, beans, peppers and tomatoes, etc.), meat, especially tougher meats suitable for slow-cooking, such as beef. poultry, sausages, and seafood are also used. while water can be used as the stew-cooking liquid, wine, stock, and beer are also common. seasoning and flavourings may also be added. stews are typically cooked at a relatively low temperature (simmered, not boiled), allowing flavors to mingle. stews are similar to soups, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two. generally, stews have less liquid than soups, are much thicker and require longer cooking over low heat. while soups are almost always served in a bowl, stews may be thick enough to be served on a plate with the gravy as a sauce over the solid ingredients.
