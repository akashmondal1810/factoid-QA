junket is a milk-based dessert, made with sweetened milk and rennet, the digestive enzyme which curdles milk. it might best be described as a custard or a very soft, sweetened cheese. to make junket, milk (usually with sugar and vanilla added) is heated to approximately body temperature and the rennet, which has been dissolved in water, is mixed in to cause the milk to "set". in the united states, junket is commonly made with a prepackaged mix of rennet and sweetener from a company eponymously known as junket.
