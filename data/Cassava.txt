the scientific name of cassava is manihot esculenta. cassava (also called yuca, mogo, or manioc) is a woody shrub cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its edible starchy tuberous root, a major source of carbohydrates. it differs from the similarly-spelled yucca, an unrelated fruit-bearing plant. cassava, when dried to a starchy, powdery (or pearly) extract is called tapioca, while its fermented, flaky version is named garri.
