french toast or eggy bread is a dish of bread soaked in eggs then fried. where french toast is served as a sweet dish, milk, sugar, or cinnamon are also commonly added before frying, and it may be then topped with sugar, butter, fruit, syrup, or other items. where it is a savory dish, it is generally fried with a pinch of salt, and then served with a sauce such as ketchup or mayonnaise.
