citrus is a common term and genus (citrus) of flowering plants in the rue family, rutaceae. the most recent research indicates an origin in australia, new caledonia and new guinea.  some researchers believe that the origin is in the part of southeast asia bordered by northeast india, burma (myanmar) and the yunnan province of china, and it is in this region that some commercial species such as oranges, mandarins, and lemons originally came. citrus fruit has been cultivated in an ever-widening area since ancient times; the best-known examples are the oranges, lemons, grapefruit, and limes.the generic name originated in latin, where it specifically referred to the plant now known as citron (c. medica). it was derived from the ancient greek word for cedar, ?????? (kí©dros). some believe this was because hellenistic jews used the fruits of c. medica during sukkot (feast of the tabernacles) in place of a cedar cone, while others state it was due to similarities in the smell of citrus leaves and fruit with that of cedar. collectively, citrus fruits and plants are also known by the romance loanword agrumes (literally "sour fruits").
