soup is a generally warm food that is made by combining ingredients such as meat and vegetables with stock, juice, water, or another liquid. hot soups are additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are extracted, forming a broth. soups are similar to stews, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two; however, soups generally have more liquid than stews. here is a "list of soups":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_soups.
