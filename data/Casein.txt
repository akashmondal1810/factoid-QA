casein is the name for a family of related phosphoprotein proteins (alphas1, alphas2, beta, kappa). these proteins are commonly found in mammalian milk, making up 80% of the proteins in cow milk and between 60% and 65% of the proteins in human milk. casein has a wide variety of uses, from being a major component of cheese, to use as a food additive, to a binder for safety matches. as a food source, casein supplies amino acids; carbohydrates; and two inorganic elements, calcium and phosphorus.
