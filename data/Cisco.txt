the scientific name of cisco is coregonus artedi. coregonus artedi, commonly known as the cisco, is a north american species of freshwater whitefish in the family salmonidae. the number of species and definition of species limits in north american ciscoes is a matter of debate. accordingly, coregonus artedi may refer either in a narrow sense to one of the several types of cisco found e.g. in the great lakes, or in a broad sense to the complex of all ciscoes in continental north american lakes, coregonus artedi sensu lato.
