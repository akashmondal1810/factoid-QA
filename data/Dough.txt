dough is a paste made out of any cereals (grains) or leguminous crops by mixing flour with a small amount of water and/or other liquid. this process is a precursor to making a wide variety of foodstuffs, particularly breads and bread-based items (e.g., crusts, dumplings), flatbreads, noodles, pastry, and similar items). this includes all kinds of breads or similar recipes made from maize, rice, sorghum, wheat, and other cereals or related crops used around the world.
