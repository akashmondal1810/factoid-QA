the scientific name of black mulberry is morus nigra. morus nigra, the black mulberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family moraceae, native to southwestern asia, where it has been cultivated for so long that its precise natural range is unknown.[1] it is known for its large number of chromosomes, as it has 154 pairs (308 individuals).the edible fruit is dark purple, almost black, when ripe, 2?3 centimetres (0.8?1.2 in) long, a compound cluster of several small drupes; it is richly flavoured, similar to the red mulberry (morus rubra) but unlike the more insipid fruit of the white mulberry (morus alba).
