the scientific name of spotted seal is phoca largha. the spotted seal (phoca largha, phoca vitulina largha), also known as the larga or largha seal, is a member of the family phocidae, and is considered a "true seal". it inhabits ice floes and waters of the north pacific ocean and adjacent seas. it is primarily found along the continental shelf of the beaufort, chukchi, bering and okhotsk seas and south to the northern yellow sea and it migrates south as far as northern huanghai and the western sea of japan. it is also found in alaska from the southeastern bristol bay to demarcation point during the ice-free seasons of summer and autumn when spotted seals mate and have pups. smaller numbers are found in the beaufort sea. it is sometimes mistaken for the harbor seal to which it is closely related and spotted seals and harbor seals often mingle together in areas where their habitats overlap.
