the scientific name of red raspberry is rubus idaeus. rubus idaeus (raspberry, also called red raspberry or occasionally as european raspberry to distinguish it from other raspberries) is a red-fruited species of rubus native to europe and northern asia and commonly cultivated in other temperate regions.the fruit is red, edible, and sweet but tart-flavoured, produced in summer or early autumn; in botanical terminology, it is not a berry at all, but an aggregate fruit of numerous drupelets around a central core. in raspberries (various species of rubus subgenus idaeobatus), the drupelets separate from the core when picked, leaving a hollow fruit, whereas in blackberries and most other species of rubus, the drupelets stay attached to the core.
