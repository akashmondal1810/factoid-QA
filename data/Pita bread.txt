pita or pitta is a round pocket bread widely consumed in many middle eastern, mediterranean, and balkan cuisines. it is prevalent in greece, the balkans the levant, the arabian peninsula and turkey. the "pocket" in pita bread is created by steam, which puffs up the dough. as the bread cools and flattens, a pocket is left in the middle. pita is used to scoop sauces or dips such as hummus and to wrap kebabs, gyros or falafel in the manner of sandwiches. much of pita's popularity in the western world since the 1970s is due to expanded use of the pocket for a type of sandwich. instead of using pita to scoop foods, people fill the pocket with various ingredients to form a sandwich.
