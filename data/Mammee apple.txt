the scientific name of mammee apple is mammea americana. the mammee apple is a berry, though it is often misinterpreted to be a drupe. it is round or slightly irregular, with a brown or grey-brown 3 mm (0.12 in) thick rind. in fact, the rind consists of the exocarp and mesocarp of the fruit, while the pulp is formed from the endocarp. the stem is thick and short. the mammee apple has more or less visible floral remnant at the apex.mammee apples' diameter ranges from 10 cm (3.9 in) to 20 cm (7.9 in). when unripe, the fruit is hard and heavy, but its flesh slightly softens when fully ripe. beneath the skin, there is a white, dry membrane, whose taste is astringent, that adheres to the flesh. the flesh is orange or yellow, not fibrous, and can have various textures (crispy or juicy, firm or tender). generally, the flesh smell is pleasant and appetizing.small fruits contain a single seed, while larger ones might have up to four. the seeds are brown, rough, oval and around 6 cm (2.4 in) long. the juice of the seed leaves an indelible stain.
