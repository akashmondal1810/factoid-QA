energy drinks are beverages whose producers advertise that they "boost energy." energy drinks generally contain methylxanthines (including caffeine), b vitamins, and herbs. other commonly used ingredients are carbonated water, guarana, yerba mate, aí_aí_, and taurine, plus various forms of ginseng, maltodextrin, inositol, carnitine, creatine, glucuronolactone, and ginkgo biloba. some contain high levels of sugar, and many brands offer artificially sweetened 'diet' versions. a common ingredient in most energy drinks is caffeine (often in the form of guarana or yerba mate). energy drinks contain about three times the amount of caffeine as cola.
