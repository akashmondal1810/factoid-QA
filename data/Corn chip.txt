a corn chip is a snack food made from cornmeal fried in oil or baked, usually in the shape of a small noodle or scoop. corn chips are thick, rigid and very crunchy. corn chips have the strong aroma and flavor of roasted corn, and are often heavily dusted with salt. while american-style corn chips and tortilla chips are both made from corn, the corn in tortilla chips is subjected to the nixtamalization process, resulting in a milder flavor and aroma, and a less rigid texture. tortilla chips also tend to be larger, thinner, and less salty than american-style corn chips.
