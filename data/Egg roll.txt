an egg roll is an appetizer and dinner, a variant of spring roll that has spread throughout the world as a staple of asian cuisine. an egg roll is made by wrapping a combination of chopped vegetables (often mostly cabbage), meat, and sometimes noodles, in a sheet of dough, dipping the dough in egg or an egg wash, then deep frying it. when compared with its cousin, the spring roll, the egg roll is generally larger, has a thicker, puffier skin, is crunchier, and has more filling. however, the terms "spring roll" and "egg roll" are often used somewhat interchangeably.
