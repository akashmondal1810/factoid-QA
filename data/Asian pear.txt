the scientific name of asian pear is pyrus pyrifolia. pyrus pyrifolia is a pear tree species native to china, japan, and korea. the tree's edible fruit is known by many names, including: asian pear, chinese pear, korean pear, japanese pear, taiwan pear, and sand pear. along with cultivars of p. í bretschneideri and p. ussuriensis, the fruit is also called the nashi pear. despite being colloquially known as an apple pear due to its appearance and texture, the fruit is not a hybrid of the two. cultivars derived from pyrus pyrifolia are grown throughout east asia, and in other countries such as australia, new zealand, and the united states (e.g. , california). traditionally in east asia the tree's flowers are a popular symbol of early spring, and it is a common sight in gardens and the countryside. the fruits are generally not baked in pies or made into jams because they have a high water content and a crisp, grainy texture, very different from the buttery european varieties. they are commonly served raw and peeled. the fruit tends to be quite large and fragrant, and when carefully wrapped (it has a tendency to bruise because of its juiciness), it can last for several weeks or more in a cold, dry place.
