the scientific name of tilefish is lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps. the great northern tilefish (lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps), or golden tile, is the largest species in the family malacanthidae (tilefishes), which grows to an average length between 38 and 44 inches (970 and 1,120 mm). the great northern tilefish is a slow-growing and long-lived species, which has four stages of life. after hatching from eggs, the larvae will be found in plankton. as they grow into juveniles, the individuals will seek shelter until finding or making their own burrows. as adults, the tilefish will continue to expand its burrow in the sediment throughout its life. the diet of the larvae is unknown, but presumed to consist of zooplankton; juveniles and adults feed upon various benthic invertebrates, crustaceans and fish. after reaching sexual maturity between 5 and 7 years of age, females will lay eggs throughout the mating season for the male to fertilize, with each female laying an average of 2.3 million eggs.
