the scientific name of pili nut is canarium ovatum. canarium ovatum, commonly known as pili, is a species of tropical tree belonging to the genus canarium. it is one of approximately 600 species in the family burseraceae. pili are native to maritime southeast asia, papua new guinea, and northern australia. they are commercially cultivated in the philippines for their edible nuts.the pili fruit is a drupe, 4 to 7 cm (1.6 to 2.8 in) long, 2.3 to 3.8 cm (0.91 to 1.50 in) in diameter, and weighs 15.7 to 45.7 g (0.035 to 0.101 lb). the skin (exocarp) is smooth, thin, shiny, and turns purplish black when the fruit ripens; the pulp (mesocarp) is fibrous, fleshy, and greenish yellow in color, and the hard shell (endocarp) within protects a normally dicotyledonous embryo. the basal end of the shell (endocarp) is pointed and the apical end is more or less blunt; between the seed and the hard shell (endocarp) is a thin, brownish, fibrous seed coat developed from the inner layer of the endocarp. this thin coat usually adheres tightly to the shell and/or the seed. much of the kernel weight is made up of the cotyledons, which are about 4.1 to 16.6% of the whole fruit; it is composed of approximately 8% carbohydrate, 11.5 to 13.9% protein, and 70% fat. kernels from some trees may be bitter, fibrous or have a turpentine odor.
